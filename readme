This branch is used for deployment.

I first deployed my API, then modified my JavaScript code to make the frontend connect to this live version, instead of the local one.

The deployed version of the site can be visited by clicking on the link located in the About section (connecting to the API may take a few seconds).

You can access the code of the local version by switching to the other branch.
